        <h2>Afua's Story</h2>
      
        <p>Afua lived in the countryside in Eritrea. She often often helped her mum by chopping wood and getting water from the river. But this was no easy task. The river was a three-hour walk away and carrying a heavy load was very tiring for Afua.</p>
        <br />
        <p>Afua's dad left home many years ago. He was taken to join the army of Eritrea - many poor people are forced to join up against their will.</p>
        <br />
        <p>She is a strong and brave girl who loves to go to school but she is told her only opportunities in life when she grows up is either to get married to someone she doesn't know or join the military. So she had to leave Eritrea.</p>
        <br />
        <p>Afua met up with two friends and they walked towards the border with Sudan. After a month, Afua was put in a lorry with about 250 other people and sent to Libya.</p>
        <br />
        <p>After three months, she finally managed to escape to the coast. This, was when she was most scared because it was only 4 meters long and held 500 people. Luckily, they were rescued by an Italian rescue boat.</p>
        <br />
        <p>This is a real story told to you without the grit and atrocities that went on in Afua's story in between. Although all ends well, we should see this as an inspiration of the daily human struggle that goes on around the world.</p>

        <h3>The Power of Relatability</h3>
      
        <p>People learn and grow when they read/hear about other people's stories. We come together when we can see ourselves in others. This makes sharing our stories imperative for the collective growth of a planet.</p>
      
        <p>We learn about others but we also learn about ourselves. If these stories don't make you want to help others, they will certainly make you look inwards and nurture the seeds of growth within yourself.</p>
