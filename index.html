            <p>What do Albert Einstein, Madeleine Albright, Casanova, Sigmund Freud, and Victor Hugo have in common? They were all refugees. The U.S. and people from around the world have benefited from the talents, perseverance, courage, and heart of a group vastly different from each other but who share a common will to survive.</p>

            <p>Refugee Stories offers volunteers the chance to help others in our community in a hands-on way. Ranging from age 5 to 95, our volunteers repeatedly tell us how their experience moves and inspires them in positive ways. Gain a new perspective on your life, get to know various cultures, and experience the true meaning of community when you sign up to volunteer with us.</p>

            <p>Refugee Stories celebrates refugees and accelerates their self-sufficiency by providing personal, meaningful welcomes and continued connections. We share transportation, technology and transformational resources to enhance success, so that refugees do not just resettle in our country, they find community and flourish. We create impacts that last a lifetime for the refugees as well as the volunteers who serve.</p>
            <p>We offer a simple welcoming gesture, but it is one that lasts a lifetime.</p>
